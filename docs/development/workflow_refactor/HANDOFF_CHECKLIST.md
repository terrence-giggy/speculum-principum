### ✅ Pre-Rehearsal Preparation

Complete these tasks at least 24 hours before rehearsal:

#### Issue Preparation
```bash
# List candidate issues for assignment (need 3)
gh issue list --label "monitor::triage" --state open --json number,title,labels --limit 10

# List candidate issues for processing (need 2)
gh issue list --label "state::assigned" --state open --json number,title,labels --limit 10
```

### ✅ Knowledge Transfer Verification

Test your understanding by answering these questions without looking at docs:

**Conceptual Understanding**:
1. What are the three phases of the rehearsal? (Answer: Assignment, Processing, Validation)
2. What is the primary success criterion? (Answer: All 5 issues processed without fatal errors)
3. What triggers an immediate rollback? (Answer: >50% failure rate, API exhaustion, data corruption, permission errors)

**Operational Knowledge**:
1. Where do you download telemetry artifacts? (Answer: GitHub Actions workflow run page, "Artifacts" section at bottom)
2. How do you manually remove a label from an issue? (Answer: `gh issue edit <number> --remove-label "<label-name>"`)
3. What's the first step if secrets validation fails? (Answer: STOP execution, verify secrets in repo settings, escalate to DevOps)

**Procedure Familiarity**:
1. How long should Phase 1 (Assignment) take? (Answer: 20 minutes, ~3-5 min per issue)
2. What section should appear in issue bodies after processing? (Answer: ## Specialist Guidance and ## Copilot Assignment)
3. What do you do if a workflow hangs for >15 minutes? (Answer: Cancel workflow, check API rate limits, verify AI provider availability)

- [ ] Can answer all 9 questions confidently
- [ ] Reviewed execution guide Section 6 (Troubleshooting) for edge cases
- [ ] Comfortable with rollback procedures (Section 7)

---

### ✅ Communication Plan

Verify you have prepared:

- [ ] **Pre-rehearsal email** - Sent 48 hours before, includes logistics and preparation steps
- [ ] **Rehearsal reminder** - Sent 24 hours before, confirms attendance and video link
- [ ] **Real-time updates template** - Prepared for posting every 15 minutes during rehearsal
- [ ] **Post-rehearsal summary template** - Ready to send within 2 hours after completion (see production rollout plan Appendix C)

**Recommended**: Draft emails in advance and schedule for automatic sending.

---

### ✅ Dry-Run Practice

Before the live rehearsal, practice these procedures in dry-run mode:

#### Practice Manual Dispatch
```
1. Go to: Actions → Operations · Workflow Assignment
2. Click: Run workflow
3. Select branch: feature/issue_processing
4. Set inputs: limit=1, dry_run=true, verbose=true
5. Click: Run workflow (green button)
6. Watch execution in real-time
7. Download artifact when complete
```
- [ ] Successfully triggered workflow assignment manually
- [ ] Monitored execution in real-time
- [ ] Downloaded and opened telemetry artifact

#### Practice Issue Verification
```bash
# View issue with all details
gh issue view <number> --json number,title,body,labels,state,assignees

# Look for specific sections in body
gh issue view <number> --json body | jq -r '.body' | grep "## AI Assessment"
```
- [ ] Can view issue details via CLI
- [ ] Can search for specific sections in issue body
- [ ] Comfortable with jq filtering (optional but helpful)

   - [ ] Yes - Read and understood
   - [ ] Partial - Read summaries, know where to find details
   - [ ] No - **STOP**: Read quick start and execution guides before proceeding

3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Do all participants know their roles and expectations?
   - [ ] Yes - All confirmed and briefed
   - [ ] Partial - Some participants need briefing
   - [ ] No - **STOP**: Send executive briefing and schedule alignment call

4. **Rollback Readiness**: If things go wrong, can you execute rollback procedures?
   - [ ] Yes - Reviewed Section 7, confident in manual recovery
   - [ ] Partial - Understand concepts, would need guide open
   - [ ] No - **STOP**: Review rollback procedures until confident

5. **Support Available**: Do you have backup if you encounter blockers?
   - [ ] Yes - DevOps and stakeholders available during rehearsal
   - [ ] Partial - Some support available
