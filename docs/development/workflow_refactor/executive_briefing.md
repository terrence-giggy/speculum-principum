- **Critical Path Coverage**: 85-92% on core modules (workflow matching, template engine, handoff builder)
- **Execution Time**: <2 seconds for batch processing (5 issues in preview mode)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, continue-on-error batch processing

### AI Integration
- **Assignment Mode**: AI-enhanced (gpt-4o) with fallback to label-based matching
- **Content Analysis**: Multi-factor scoring (labels + content + patterns)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Tracked and logged for quality monitoring
- **Rate Limit Protection**: Caching, exponential backoff, quota awareness

### Workflow Automation
- **Assignment Schedule**: Every 2 hours (ready to enable)
- **Processing Schedule**: Every 4 hours (ready to enable)
- **Daily Operations**: Full pipeline dry-run at 06:30 UTC
- **Concurrency Controls**: Workflow-level guards prevent overlaps

### Observability
- **Telemetry Format**: Structured JSONL events with CLI metadata
- **Artifact Capture**: Automatic archiving in GitHub Actions
- **State Tracking**: Label transitions, processing duration, Copilot assignments
- **Error Logging**: Detailed context for debugging and root cause analysis

## Rehearsal Plan (Next Step)

### Scope
**90-minute supervised execution** with stakeholder oversight:
1. **Workflow Assignment** (Live): 3 issues processed
2. **Issue Processing** (Live): 2 issues processed
3. **Daily Operations** (Dry-Run): System validation

### Participants Required
- Workflow Modernization Lead (facilitator)
- Site Monitoring Ops
- Workflow Assignment Team
- Copilot Operations
- DevOps

### Success Criteria
- All issues transition through state machine correctly
- Labels applied/removed as expected (no drift)
- AI Assessment, Specialist Guidance, and Copilot Assignment sections generated
- Telemetry artifacts captured
- No API rate limit or permission errors

### Risk Mitigation
- Rollback procedures documented and tested
- Emergency contact tree established
- Issue backups captured before execution
- Abort protocol defined for critical failures

**Proposed Date**: October 7, 2025 at 14:00 UTC (pending stakeholder confirmation)

---

## Production Rollout Strategy (Post-Rehearsal)

### Phased Deployment (4 Weeks)

**Week 1 - Scheduled Automation**:
- Enable workflow assignment (every 2 hours, 10 issue limit)
- Enable issue processing (every 4 hours, 5 issue limit)
- 48-hour monitoring window with on-call coverage

**Week 2 - Capacity Scaling**:
- Increase assignment to 20 issues per run
- Increase processing to 10 issues per run
- Optimize schedule coordination

**Week 3 - Quality Assurance**:
- Automated validation workflows (label drift, orphans, staleness)
- Copilot completion tracking and SLA monitoring
- Specialist guidance quality reviews (10 issues/week sample)

**Week 4 - Full Automation**:
- Daily operations workflow transitions to live mode
- Complete end-to-end pipeline without manual intervention
- Archive legacy workflows and documentation

### Rollback Triggers
- GitHub API rate limit exhaustion
- >50% failure rate over 6 hours
- Data corruption or conflicting states
- Quality degradation (<50% Copilot completion for 3 days)

---

## Resource Requirements

### Stakeholder Time Commitment

**Rehearsal (One-time)**:
- 90-minute supervised execution
- 2-hour post-rehearsal validation and sign-off

**Week 1 (High Touch)**:
- Daily 15-minute status check
- On-call availability for anomalies
- Weekly 30-minute review meeting

**Weeks 2-4 (Moderate Touch)**:
- Weekly 30-minute review meeting
- Ad-hoc consultation for issues

**Post-Rollout (Low Touch)**:
- Monthly metrics review
- Quarterly quality sampling

### Infrastructure Costs

**API Usage Estimates** (based on 240 issues/day at full capacity):
- GitHub API: Within free tier limits
- Google Search API: ~$0 (within 100 calls/day quota)
- OpenAI API (gpt-4o): ~$5-10/day for assignment analysis
- Alternative: Anthropic API (similar cost profile)

**GitHub Actions Minutes**:
- Estimated: ~500 minutes/month
- Well within free tier for public repos

**No additional infrastructure required** ‚Äî All components use existing tooling.
