- ✅ **4-week production rollout plan** with phased deployment
- ✅ **Executive briefing** for C-level decision-making
- ✅ **Quick start guide** for next engineer onboarding
- ✅ **Complete documentation set** (16 docs, 2,500+ lines)
- ✅ **85% confidence rating** backed by test results and metrics

### Current State
**Technical**: Production-ready with comprehensive test coverage and validation  
**Documentation**: Complete and navigable with clear ownership and next steps  
**Process**: Rehearsal plan defined with stakeholder alignment framework  
**Risk**: Low overall risk with documented mitigation strategies

## Next Steps (Recommended Timeline)

### Immediate (By October 5, 2025)
1. **Stakeholder Confirmation**: All participants confirm availability for October 7, 2025 at 14:00 UTC
2. **Executive Approval**: Decision-maker reviews executive briefing and approves rehearsal
3. **Issue Preparation**: Operations team tags 5 target issues (3 for assignment, 2 for processing)

### Rehearsal (October 7, 2025)
1. **Execute supervised live run** following rehearsal execution guide (90 minutes)
2. **Collect telemetry artifacts** from all 3 workflow phases
3. **Validate results** against success criteria checklist
4. **Get stakeholder sign-off** for production rollout

### Production Rollout (Starting Week of October 14, 2025)
1. **Week 1**: Enable scheduled workflows (assignment every 2 hours, processing every 4 hours)
2. **Week 2**: Scale capacity (increase batch sizes based on performance)
3. **Week 3**: Implement quality assurance automation (validation workflows, tracking)
4. **Week 4**: Enable full pipeline automation (daily operations live mode)

### Post-Rollout (Week of November 11, 2025)
1. **Metrics review**: Validate >95% flow-through, label quality, Copilot completion
2. **Retrospective**: Lessons learned session with stakeholders
3. **Continuous improvement**: Prioritize enhancement backlog

## Risk Management

### Low Risk Items (Mitigated)
- ✅ Code quality: 77% coverage with critical paths well-tested
- ✅ GitHub Actions: Validated with secrets guardrails and concurrency controls
- ✅ Documentation: Comprehensive with clear ownership and procedures
- ✅ Rollback: Procedures documented and tested (manual restoration possible)

### Medium Risk Items (Monitored)
- ⚠️ Live GitHub Actions execution: Rehearsal will validate under real conditions
- ⚠️ Inter-workflow coordination: Concurrency controls in place, will monitor for conflicts
- ⚠️ AI API quotas: Usage tracking implemented, fallback to rule-based matching available

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Supervised rehearsal**: Stakeholder oversight with immediate rollback capability
- **Phased rollout**: Weekly go/no-go decisions based on metrics
- **Continuous monitoring**: Telemetry capture and dashboard integration
- **Quality sampling**: Weekly review of 10 issues for guidance completeness
