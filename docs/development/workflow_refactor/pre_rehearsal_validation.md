## 3. GitHub Actions Validation

### 3.1 Workflow Files Audit
All required workflow files present and configured:

| Workflow | Purpose | Status | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| `ops-workflow-assignment.yml` | AI-powered workflow assignment | ✅ Active | Secrets validation, discovery guards, triage telemetry |
| `ops-issue-processing.yml` | Unified issue processing | ✅ Active | State machine enforcement, smoke tests, artifact capture |
| `ops-daily-operations.yml` | End-to-end dry-run pipeline | ✅ Active | Monitor→Assign→Process chain, telemetry archiving |
| `ops-site-monitoring.yml` | Site content monitoring | ✅ Active | Google API integration |
| `ops-setup-monitoring.yml` | Repository initialization | ✅ Active | Label management |
| `ops-weekly-cleanup.yml` | Data retention management | ✅ Active | Automated cleanup |
| `ops-status-check.yml` | System health validation | ✅ Active | Configuration checks |

**Retired**:
- ✅ `ops-copilot-auto-process.yml` - Removed as part of unified pipeline consolidation

### 3.2 Secrets Guardrails
All workflows now include preflight secret validation:

**Required Secrets**:
- ✅ `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Auto-injected by GitHub Actions
- ✅ `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - For site monitoring
- ✅ `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` - For site monitoring
- ✅ At least one of: `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For AI features

**Validation Strategy**: Hard fail on missing secrets to prevent silent dry-run successes

### 3.3 Permissions Audit
| Workflow | Contents | Issues | PRs | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-----|-------|
| Assignment | read | write | - | Can label and comment |
| Processing | write | write | write | Can commit and create PRs |
| Daily Ops | read | read | - | Read-only for dry-run safety |

## 7. Confidence Assessment

### 7.1 Component Readiness
| Component | Readiness | Confidence | Blocker |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Site Monitoring | ✅ Ready | High | None |
| AI Workflow Assignment | ✅ Ready | High | None |
| Issue Processing | ✅ Ready | High | None |
| Batch Processing | ✅ Ready | High | None |
| Copilot Handoff | ✅ Ready | High | None |
| GitHub Actions | ✅ Ready | Medium | Requires live validation |
| Telemetry | ✅ Ready | Medium | Requires live validation |
| Documentation | ✅ Ready | High | None |

### 7.2 Overall Assessment
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR LIVE REHEARSAL**

**Confidence Level**: **85%**

**Remaining Uncertainty**:
- GitHub Actions live execution (mitigated by dry-run validation and manual dispatch controls)
- Telemetry artifact collection in production GitHub Actions environment (mitigated by clear archiving steps)
- Inter-workflow coordination under concurrent execution (mitigated by concurrency controls and state labels)

**Recommendation**: Proceed with supervised live rehearsal following the plan in [`live_rehearsal_plan.md`](./live_rehearsal_plan.md). The 90-minute window with stakeholder presence provides adequate oversight to identify and address any unforeseen issues.

## 8. Next Steps

### 8.1 Immediate Actions (Pre-Rehearsal)
1. **Schedule rehearsal** - Confirm stakeholder availability for 2025-10-07 14:00 UTC
2. **Prepare target issues** - Tag and verify state of 5 issues (3 for assignment, 2 for processing)
3. **Set up monitoring** - Open dashboards and GitHub Actions console in split view
4. **Brief stakeholders** - Share rehearsal plan and role assignments

### 8.2 During Rehearsal
1. Execute workflow assignment (live mode, limit=3)
2. Execute issue processing (live mode, batch-size=2)
3. Execute daily operations (dry-run confirmation)
4. Collect telemetry artifacts
5. Document observations and anomalies

### 8.3 Post-Rehearsal
1. Validate issue states and label transitions
2. Review telemetry JSONL files
3. Update progress log with findings
4. Complete sign-off checklist
5. Prepare production rollout plan or iterate on gaps
