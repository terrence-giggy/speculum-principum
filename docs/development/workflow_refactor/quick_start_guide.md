# Quick Start Guide for Next Engineer

**Last Updated**: October 3, 2025  
**Project Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for Live Rehearsal  
**Current Phase**: Pre-Rehearsal Preparation

---

## üéØ What You Need to Know in 5 Minutes

The workflow refactor is **complete and validated**. Your job is to **execute the live rehearsal** and **manage the production rollout**.

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ All code complete (560/562 tests passing, 77% coverage)
- ‚úÖ All GitHub Actions configured and tested
- ‚úÖ All documentation complete (15 docs, 2,500+ lines)
- ‚úÖ Pre-rehearsal validation confirms 85% confidence

**Next Steps**:
1. Confirm rehearsal date (proposed: Oct 7, 2025 at 14:00 UTC)
2. Execute supervised rehearsal (90 minutes with stakeholders)
3. Collect artifacts and validate results
4. Get sign-off and proceed to production rollout (4 weeks)

gh issue list --label "site-monitor" --state open --json number,title,labels --limit 20
```

### GitHub Actions
```bash
# List recent workflow runs
gh run list --limit 10

# View specific run details
gh run view <run-id>

## üé¨ Rehearsal Execution Checklist

### T-30 Minutes (Preparation)
- [ ] All stakeholders confirmed and available
- [ ] Video conference link shared
- [ ] Target issues identified and tagged:
  - 3 issues with `monitor::triage` (for assignment)
  - 2 issues with `state::assigned` (for processing)
- [ ] Dashboards open (GitHub Actions, Issues, Telemetry)
- [ ] Note-taker assigned with template document
- [ ] Secrets validated (run ops-daily-operations in dry-run)

### Phase 1: Assignment (T+0 to T+20 min)
- [ ] Navigate to Actions ‚Üí Workflow Assignment ‚Üí Run workflow
- [ ] Configure: branch=feature/issue_processing, limit=3, dry_run=false, verbose=true
- [ ] Monitor execution (3-5 min per issue expected)
- [ ] Verify labels updated, AI Assessment added, monitor::triage removed
- [ ] Download telemetry artifact

### Phase 2: Processing (T+20 to T+50 min)
- [ ] Navigate to Actions ‚Üí Issue Processing ‚Üí Run workflow
- [ ] Configure: branch=feature/issue_processing, batch_size=2, dry_run=false, verbose=true
- [ ] Monitor execution (5-10 min per issue expected)
- [ ] Verify Specialist Guidance, Copilot Assignment sections added
- [ ] Verify Copilot assigned with due date
- [ ] Download telemetry artifact

### Phase 3: Validation (T+50 to T+65 min)
- [ ] Navigate to Actions ‚Üí Daily Operations ‚Üí Run workflow
- [ ] Use default dry-run inputs
- [ ] Monitor summary output
- [ ] Download telemetry artifact
- [ ] Verify no label drift detected

### Post-Rehearsal (T+65 to T+90 min)
- [ ] Export issue states: `gh issue list --label "site-monitor" --state all --json number,title,labels,state,assignees > rehearsal-state.json`
- [ ] Screenshot workflow summaries and issue bodies
- [ ] Complete validation checklist in execution guide
- [ ] Document observations and anomalies
- [ ] Get stakeholder sign-off
- [ ] Update progress log with results

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Secret Validation Fails
**Symptom**: Workflow fails at "Validate required secrets" step  
**Solution**: Verify GitHub secrets are set (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions)  
**Required**: GITHUB_TOKEN, GOOGLE_API_KEY, GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID, OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

### Workflow Hangs or Times Out
**Symptom**: Workflow runs >15 minutes without completing  
**Solution**: Click "Cancel workflow", check GitHub API rate limits, verify AI provider availability  
**Escalate**: If rate limits exhausted, follow rollback procedures in execution guide

### Label Drift Detected
**Symptom**: Issues have both monitor::triage and state::assigned labels  
**Solution**: This indicates assignment workflow didn't remove temporary label  
**Fix**: Manually remove monitor::triage via `gh issue edit <number> --remove-label "monitor::triage"`

### Missing Issue Sections
**Symptom**: Issue body doesn't contain ## AI Assessment or ## Specialist Guidance  
**Solution**: Check workflow logs for errors during section generation  
**Verify**: Template files exist in templates/ directory, workflow configuration valid

### Copilot Not Assigned
**Symptom**: Issue processed but no @github-copilot[bot] assignee  
**Solution**: Verify Copilot account has repository access (Settings ‚Üí Collaborators)  
**Alternative**: Manually assign via `gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee github-copilot[bot]`

## üìû Emergency Contacts

| Issue Type | Contact | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| GitHub Actions failure | DevOps | Check Actions tab, review logs |
| API rate limits | Technical Lead | Monitor quotas, implement backoff |
| Permission errors | GitHub Admin | Verify repo settings, workflow permissions |
| AI provider issues | AI/API Lead | Check OpenAI/Anthropic status, switch provider |
| Critical blocker | Workflow Lead | Execute rollback per Section 7 of execution guide |

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Rehearsal Succeeds If**:
- ‚úÖ All 5 issues processed without fatal errors
- ‚úÖ Labels transition correctly (monitor::triage ‚Üí workflow::*, state::assigned ‚Üí state::copilot)
- ‚úÖ AI Assessment, Specialist Guidance, Copilot Assignment sections generated
- ‚úÖ Telemetry artifacts captured and archived
- ‚úÖ No API rate limit violations or permission errors
- ‚úÖ Stakeholders approve moving to production rollout

**Rehearsal Needs Iteration If**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1-2 issues fail but cause is understood and fixable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Quality issues in generated content (templates need adjustment)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance slower than expected but within acceptable range

**Rehearsal Fails If**:
- ‚ùå >50% of issues fail to process
- ‚ùå Data corruption or conflicting states
- ‚ùå Critical security or permission issue
- ‚ùå API exhaustion prevents completion

**You've got this!** The previous engineer did comprehensive preparation. Your job is execution and delivery. Follow the guides, communicate clearly, and trust the validated system.

**Questions?** Check the docs first, then reach out to stakeholders. All contact info is in the execution guide.

**Good luck with the rehearsal!** üéâ
