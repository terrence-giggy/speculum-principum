## Quick Start for Next Engineer

**New here?** Start with [`quick_start_guide.md`](./quick_start_guide.md) for a 5-minute overview and execution checklist.

**Current Priority**: Execute supervised live rehearsal (proposed October 7, 2025 at 14:00 UTC) following [`rehearsal_execution_guide.md`](./rehearsal_execution_guide.md).

**Key Documents**:
- Executive decision-maker? Read [`executive_briefing.md`](./executive_briefing.md)
- Technical validator? Read [`pre_rehearsal_validation.md`](./pre_rehearsal_validation.md)
- Rehearsal facilitator? Read [`rehearsal_execution_guide.md`](./rehearsal_execution_guide.md)
- Post-rehearsal planner? Read [`production_rollout_plan.md`](./production_rollout_plan.md)

## Purpose
The workflow refactor project consolidates the end-to-end intelligence pipelineâ€”site monitoring, workflow assignment, and issue processingâ€”into a single, coherent system. The objective is to eliminate redundant execution paths, streamline specialist guidance, and ensure every monitored update results in a Copilot-ready issue enriched with high-quality analyst direction.

## Objectives
- Align the three core workflows so that site monitoring, workflow assignment, and issue processing operate as a continuous pipeline.
- Replace overlapping "basic issue-processing" and "issue-processing-copilot" paths with a unified specialist-guided issue processor that hands off to Copilot for document creation.
- Elevate label management so AI-powered workflow assignment both adds relevant workflow labels and removes temporary discovery labels.
- Guarantee that every generated issue contains actionable specialist guidance tailored to the target content.
- Deliver a comprehensive launch plan that minimizes operational downtime and ensures testability at each phase.

## Success Criteria
- **Workflow flow-through**: >95% of monitored updates progress automatically from site monitoring to Copilot-ready issues without manual orchestration.
- **Label quality**: Labels applied by workflow assignment consistently match at least one validated workflow schema, with temporary discovery labels removed within the same execution.
- **Specialist signal**: Issues entering Copilot processing contain at least one specialist guidance block that follows the standardized prompt contract.
- **Operational simplicity**: Only one issue-processing entrypoint remains, with clear CLI/automation hooks and updated documentation.

## Workstreams
1. **Current State Assessment** â€“ Capture the as-is behaviors, configurations, and operational constraints across the three workflows.
2. **Target Architecture Definition** â€“ Document the desired end-to-end flow, data contracts, and automation touchpoints.
3. **Refactor Planning & Execution** â€“ Provide a phased implementation plan, acceptance criteria, and validation strategy.
4. **Specialist Alignment** â€“ Standardize specialist prompt contracts, Copilot handoff instructions, and knowledge base updates.

## Telemetry & Observability
- CLI commands now register a default JSONL telemetry publisher located at `artifacts/telemetry/{command}.jsonl` so dry-run automation and GitHub Actions can collect structured events without additional wiring.
- Override the destination by setting `SPECULUM_CLI_TELEMETRY_PATH` (exact file) or `SPECULUM_CLI_TELEMETRY_DIR`/`SPECULUM_ARTIFACTS_DIR` (directory). Parent directories are created automatically.
- Events emitted by `SiteMonitorService` and `BatchProcessor` gain CLI metadata via `cli_command` and `cli_session_id`, enabling dashboards to filter by invocation.
- Sample summary event:
	```json
	{
		"event_type": "batch_processor.summary",
		"timestamp": "2025-10-01T14:12:03.482193+00:00",
		"cli_command": "process-issues",
		"cli_session_id": "b8a1e6c3d2b34b3b8797e36f2a4f8347",
		"metrics": {
			"processed_count": 5,
			"copilot_assignments": {
