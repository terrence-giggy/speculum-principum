## Phase 1: Soft Launch (Week 3)

### Objectives

- Validate new system with limited scope
- Identify any production-specific issues
- Build confidence before wider rollout

### Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Code (Monday)**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag v1.5.0-beta
   git push origin v1.5.0-beta
   ```

2. **Enable Feature Flag (Monday)**
   ```yaml
   # config.yaml
   features:
     unified_pipeline:
       enabled: true
       mode: beta  # Limited to beta issues only
       beta_issue_labels: ['beta-test']
   ```

3. **Create Beta Test Issues (Monday-Tuesday)**
   - Create 5 test issues with `beta-test` label
   - Manually add `site-monitor` label
   - Monitor processing through pipeline

4. **Deploy GitHub Action (Tuesday)**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/ops-unified-pipeline.yml
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:  # Manual only for beta
   ```

5. **Manual Testing (Tuesday-Thursday)**
   ```bash
   # Test individual issue processing
   gh workflow run ops-unified-pipeline.yml \
     -f issue_number=<beta-issue> \
     -f stage=auto
   
   # Monitor results
   gh run list --workflow=ops-unified-pipeline.yml
   ```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] 5/5 beta issues processed successfully
- [ ] Labels transition correctly through all stages
- [ ] Copilot receives properly formatted guidance
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Performance within expected range (<30s per issue)
- [ ] Zero manual interventions required

### Monitoring

**Metrics to Track**:
- Processing time per issue
- API call counts (GitHub, OpenAI)
- Error rates
- Label transition accuracy
- User feedback from beta testers

**Dashboard**: Create Grafana dashboard with:
```
- Pipeline throughput (issues/hour)
- Stage duration (analysis, preparation)
- Error rate by stage
- API cost per issue
- Success rate percentage
```

### Go/No-Go Decision (Friday)

**Go Criteria**:
- All success criteria met
- No critical or high-severity bugs
- Performance acceptable
- Team confidence high

**No-Go Actions**:
- Rollback feature flag
- Analyze failures
- Create fix plan
- Reschedule rollout

## Phase 2: Parallel Operation (Week 4)

### Objectives

- Run new and old systems side-by-side
- Validate consistency between systems
- Build operational confidence

### Deployment Steps

1. **Enable Parallel Mode (Monday)**
   ```yaml
   # config.yaml
   features:
     unified_pipeline:
       enabled: true
       mode: parallel  # Both systems active
       comparison_mode: true  # Log differences
   ```

2. **Update GitHub Actions (Monday)**
   ```yaml
   # ops-unified-pipeline.yml - Enable label triggers
   on:
     issues:
       types: [labeled]
     workflow_dispatch:
   ```

3. **Comparative Testing (Monday-Wednesday)**
   - Select 20 existing issues
   - Process with both old and new commands
   - Compare outputs (labels, assignments, content)
   - Document any discrepancies

4. **Monitor Production Traffic (Wednesday-Friday)**
   - New system processes ~20% of issues
   - Old system continues handling majority
   - Compare results for same issues

### Success Criteria

- [ ] 100% consistency between old and new outputs
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] New system handles 20+ issues without errors
- [ ] Response times comparable to old system
- [ ] No data loss or corruption

### Discrepancy Resolution

If outputs differ:
1. **Analyze root cause**: Is new behavior correct or bug?
2. **Determine impact**: Does it affect functionality?
3. **Decision**:
   - If new behavior is correct improvement → Document
   - If bug → Fix immediately
   - If breaking change → Re-evaluate rollout

## Phase 3: Gradual Cutover (Weeks 5-6)

### Week 5: 50% Traffic

**Monday - Enable Auto-Triggers**:
```yaml
# ops-unified-pipeline.yml
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */4 * * *'  # Every 4 hours
  workflow_dispatch:
```

**Tuesday - Add Deprecation Warnings**:
```python
def handle_process_issues_command(args):
    logger.warning("""
    ⚠️  DEPRECATION NOTICE
    
    The 'process-issues' command is deprecated.
    Please migrate to: process-pipeline --stage preparation
    
    This command will be removed in version 2.0
    See: docs/development/workflow-refactor/05-migration-strategy.md
    """)
    # Continue with old behavior
```

**Wednesday-Friday - Monitor Split Traffic**:
- New system: ~50% of issues (via label triggers)
- Old system: ~50% of issues (via old workflows)
- Track migration progress dashboard

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] New system handles 50% traffic successfully
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] No user complaints
- [ ] Deprecation warnings visible to users

### Week 6: 100% Traffic

**Monday - Disable Old Workflows**:
```yaml
# ops-issue-processing-pr.yml
name: DEPRECATED - Operations -3 Issue Processing

on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Keep for emergency only
  # All automatic triggers removed
```

**Tuesday - Redirect Old Commands**:
```python
def handle_process_issues_command(args):
    logger.info("Redirecting to unified pipeline...")
    # Convert args and delegate to new command
    args.stage = 'preparation'
    return handle_process_pipeline_command(args)
```

**Wednesday-Friday - Monitor Full Load**:
- New system handles 100% of traffic
- Old commands redirect to new system
- Old workflows disabled (manual only)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 100% traffic on new system
- [ ] Error rate remains < 1%
- [ ] Performance stable under full load
- [ ] No escalations or incidents

## Phase 4: Cleanup (Week 7)

### Remove Deprecated Code

**Monday - Final Usage Check**:
```bash
# Analyze last week's logs
grep "process-issues\|process-copilot-issues" site_monitor.log

# Should be zero or minimal redirects only
```

**Tuesday - Mark Commands as Removed**:
```python
def handle_process_issues_command(args):
    raise DeprecatedCommandError(
        "The 'process-issues' command has been removed.\n"
        "Use: process-pipeline --stage preparation\n\n"
        "Migration guide: docs/development/workflow-refactor/05-migration-strategy.md"
    )
```

**Wednesday - Archive Old Workflows**:
```bash
git mv .github/workflows/ops-issue-processing-pr.yml \
       .github/workflows/archive/ops-issue-processing-pr.yml.bak

git commit -m "chore: Archive deprecated issue processing workflow"
```

**Thursday - Update Documentation**:
- [ ] Remove old command references from README
- [ ] Update all examples to use new command
- [ ] Archive old documentation
- [ ] Publish migration success blog post

**Friday - Celebrate! 🎉**
