# Workflow Refactoring Project - Executive Summary

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Consolidate fragmented three-stage automation workflow into unified, AI-enhanced pipeline that automatically processes discovered content from site monitoring through to Copilot-driven document generation.

**Timeline**: 8 weeks (2 weeks development, 6 weeks rollout)  
**Status**: Planning Phase Complete  
**Started**: 2025-09-29

## The Problem

### Current State Issues

The existing system has **three separate workflows** with overlapping responsibilities and manual handoffs:

1. **Site Monitoring** - Discovers content, creates issues with `site-monitor` label
2. **Workflow Assignment** - AI analyzes content, assigns specialist labels *(but doesn't remove discovery label)*
3. **Issue Processing** - TWO separate commands with different behaviors:
   - `process-issues` - Creates deliverables directly, makes PRs *(doesn't assign to Copilot)*
   - `process-copilot-issues` - Creates guidance for Copilot *(requires manual assignment first)*

### Critical Gaps Identified

- ❌ **No automatic label lifecycle**: Labels accumulate, discovery labels never removed
- ❌ **No automatic progression**: Each stage requires manual trigger
- ❌ **Duplicate processing logic**: Two commands doing similar work differently
- ❌ **Unclear responsibilities**: Confusion about which command to use when
- ❌ **Manual Copilot assignment**: System doesn't automatically assign issues to Copilot

**Root Cause**: User expectation was "assign task to Copilot and it processes automatically" but system requires manual intervention at every stage.

## The Solution

### Unified Pipeline Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    AUTOMATED PIPELINE                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Site Monitoring → AI Analysis → Specialist Assignment → 
Guidance Generation → Copilot Assignment → Document Creation

[site-monitor] → [analyzing] → [specialist-type] → 
[processing] → [copilot-assigned] → [completed]
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Single Processing Command**: `process-pipeline` replaces both `process-issues` and `process-copilot-issues`
2. **Automatic Label Lifecycle**: Labels transition automatically, old labels removed
3. **AI-Powered Assignment**: GitHub Models API semantic analysis integrated
4. **Event-Driven Pipeline**: Label changes trigger next stage automatically
5. **Specialist Guidance**: Rich prompts generated for Copilot, not direct deliverables
6. **End-to-End Automation**: Zero manual intervention required

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components (New)

1. **PipelineOrchestrator** (`src/core/pipeline_orchestrator.py`)
   - Central coordinator for all processing
   - Intelligent stage detection and routing
   - Integrates AI assignment and guidance generation

2. **LabelStateManager** (`src/core/label_state_manager.py`)
   - State machine for label transitions
   - Automatic cleanup of old labels
   - Validates state transitions

3. **GuidanceGenerator** (`src/workflow/guidance_generator.py`)
   - Generates specialist-specific prompts
   - Replaces direct deliverable generation
   - Structured instructions for Copilot

4. **Unified CLI Command** (`main.py`)
   - `process-pipeline --stage [auto|analysis|preparation|all]`
   - Replaces `process-issues` and `process-copilot-issues`
   - Backward compatibility during transition

### Integration Points

- **Reuses**: AIWorkflowAssignmentAgent, SpecialistWorkflowConfigManager, TemplateEngine
- **Replaces**: Duplicate batch processing logic, manual workflow routing
- **Enhances**: Automatic Copilot assignment, label lifecycle management

### Backward Compatibility

**Transition Period** (Weeks 4-6):

- Comparative testing validates consistency
- Gradual traffic shift (0% → 50% → 100%)

**Deprecation** (Week 7):
- Old commands raise errors with migration instructions
- Old workflows archived
- Documentation updated

### Rollback Procedures

**Immediate Rollback** (< 5 minutes):
1. Disable new workflow via GitHub Actions
2. Re-enable old workflows
3. Revert feature flag in config
4. Communicate to team

**Triggers**: Critical bugs, data loss, error rate > 5%, security issues
