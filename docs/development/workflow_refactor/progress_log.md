## 2025-10-03 — Ops Rollout Briefing & Changelog Published

**What happened**
- Authored [`ops_migration_brief.md`](./ops_migration_brief.md) to align Site Monitoring Ops and Copilot Operations on the unified pipeline, including failure-handling playbooks and a proposed rehearsal schedule.
- Created [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) to formalize the modernization history and highlight the latest guardrail and telemetry improvements for stakeholders.
- Updated the migration checklist to mark rollout support tasks complete and linked the new collateral for future audits.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Proposed the supervised rehearsal window for 2025-10-07 at 14:00 UTC, leaving 24 hours for stakeholder conflicts to surface.
- Left rehearsal acknowledgement as a follow-up item in `#wf-modernization`; no tooling blocks anticipated.
- Changelog entries aggregate existing progress log context so future updates stay concise.

**Next up**
1. Confirm rehearsal attendance and capture post-run action items in the progress log.
2. Wire rehearsal telemetry artifacts into observability dashboards once generated.
3. Prepare post-rehearsal changelog addendum summarizing outcomes and any contract adjustments.

**Validation**
- _Documentation updates only; no automated tests executed._

## 2025-10-03 — Legacy Copilot Workflow Retired

**What happened**
- Removed `.github/workflows/ops-copilot-auto-process.yml`, consolidating automation on the unified assignment + processing pipeline.
- Updated `.github/workflows/README.md` to eliminate references to the deprecated workflow and highlight the daily-ops dry-run path.
- Cleared remaining backlog references so future action items point to the new guardrailed workflows.

**Decisions / Notes**
- No replacement workflow needed; the combination of `ops-workflow-assignment`, `ops-issue-processing`, and `ops-daily-operations` now covers monitoring-to-Copilot handoffs.
- Retained telemetry artifacts from the new workflows as canonical sources for pipeline health.
- Historical runs remain accessible via GitHub Actions history for audit but should be considered read-only.

**Next up**
1. Communicate the retirement to Ops channels and update any runbooks pointing to the legacy workflow.
2. Ensure alerting rules or scheduled jobs no longer reference the removed workflow ID.
3. Monitor initial runs of the daily-ops workflow to confirm there are no gaps created by the retirement.

**Validation**
- _Documentation-only change; no automated tests executed._


## 2025-10-03 — Live Rehearsal Plan Published

**What happened**
- Authored `live_rehearsal_plan.md`, detailing prerequisites, step-by-step execution, rollback, and sign-off for a supervised live-mode run.
- Scoped the rehearsal to three assignment issues and two processing issues to balance confidence-building with risk mitigation.
- Embedded communication and artifact-handling guidance so stakeholders know what to monitor and how to archive telemetry.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Monitoring remains aggregate-only during rehearsal to avoid introducing unexpected issues mid-run; assignment/processing cover live writes.
- Plan assumes all guardrail workflows (monitor, assignment, processing) are executed manually; daily-ops dry-run is used post-run for validation.
- Rollback protocol emphasizes label reversion and incident logging to maintain auditability.

**Next up**
1. Schedule the rehearsal window and secure attendance from Ops, DevOps, and Copilot stakeholders.
2. Prepare target issues (labels/state) ahead of the rehearsal to minimize live triage.
3. Feed telemetry artifacts from the rehearsal into dashboards and update docs with observed data points.

**Validation**
- _Documentation-only change; no automated tests executed._


## 2025-10-03 — Secrets Guardrails Applied to Ops Workflows

**What happened**
- Added preflight secret validation steps to `ops-workflow-assignment.yml`, `ops-issue-processing.yml`, and `ops-daily-operations.yml` so runs fail fast when Google or LLM credentials are missing.
- Required at least one of `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, reflecting the AI-first workflow contract while still permitting fallback when configured.
- Extended the migration checklist to record the new guardrails and document the expectation for telemetry-ready secrets coverage.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Left `GITHUB_TOKEN` validation in place even though GitHub auto-injects it, giving clearer diagnostics if scopes are ever altered through environment overrides.
- Chose warnings-to-errors strategy (hard fail) to prevent silent dry-run successes that would mask missing AI credentials during rollout rehearsals.
- Future enhancement: emit explicit summary lines with which provider is active once secrets plumbing is expanded to pass provider metadata to telemetry.

**Next up**
1. Execute the supervised live-mode rehearsal following the published plan.
2. Assess whether to surface provider selection (OpenAI vs Anthropic) in CLI output to aid operators during investigations.
3. Monitor the first few guarded runs to confirm validation messaging is clear for operators.

**Validation**
- _Configuration/documentation change; relied on existing e2e suite from earlier run._


## 2025-10-03 — Daily Ops Dry-Run Workflow Created

**What happened**
- Added `.github/workflows/ops-daily-operations.yml` to orchestrate monitor → assign-workflows → process-issues in a guarded dry-run sequence with telemetry capture and archived logs.
- Wired manual inputs for assignment limit and processing batch size so operators can tune rehearsal scope without editing YAML.
- Ensured summary output documents the dry-run nature of the run and the location of archived artifacts for post-run review.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Kept permissions scoped to read-only since the workflow never performs live writes; once promoted to production we can revisit.
- Reused the `state::assigned` label filter during processing to keep parity with the dedicated issue-processing guardrails.
- Scheduled the workflow for 06:30 UTC to land ahead of business hours while keeping cost low via conservative limits.

**Next up**
1. Pair with DevOps to stage a live-mode rehearsal once guardrails are signed off by stakeholders.
2. Integrate daily-ops telemetry artifacts into existing dashboards for ongoing visibility.
3. Confirm daily-ops scheduling cadence meets Ops expectations post-rehearsal.

**Validation**
- _Workflow-only change; relied on previously passing CLI e2e suite for contract integrity._


## 2025-10-03 — Issue Processing Guardrails & Smoke Automation

**What happened**
- Created `.github/workflows/ops-issue-processing.yml` with a GH CLI inventory gate, state::assigned enforcement, and monitor::triage drift detection so processing only starts when assignment is complete.
- Added an embedded smoke-test dry run that captures Markdown-rich CLI output and archives telemetry/log artifacts for operators before any live mutations occur.
- Updated `ops-issue-processing-pr.yml` to reuse the state::assigned label filter, telemetry capture path, and continue-on-error guard so manual dispatch stays aligned with the unified processor.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Default manual dispatch remains dry-run to protect production until rollout rehearsal approves live execution; scheduled and label-triggered runs operate in live mode automatically.
- Reused the telemetry directory pattern from assignment workflows so DevOps can aggregate JSONL artifacts across the pipeline without custom wiring.
- Deferred decommissioning of `ops-copilot-auto-process.yml` to a follow-up change so historical automation can be sunset alongside daily-operations wiring.

**Next up**
1. Backfill runbook screenshots/log snippets now that the new workflow is in place.
2. Monitor first scheduled runs to verify the guardrail checks behave as expected on GitHub-hosted runners.
3. Evaluate whether additional smoke assertions (e.g., section content checks) should surface in the summary output.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`


## 2025-10-03 — Workflow Assignment GH Action Guardrails Hardened

**What happened**
- Reworked `.github/workflows/ops-workflow-assignment.yml` to gate automation on `state::discovery` counts via the GitHub CLI, aligning triggers with the unified label/state contract.
- Added a post-run validation step that fails the job if any `state::assigned` issues still carry `monitor::triage`, preventing state drift before issue processing picks up the queue.
- Surfaced discovery and triage counts in the job summary while removing the brittle grep-based statistics parsing, giving operators immediate telemetry when the workflow completes.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Retained the dependency install step so future inline Python helpers (e.g., PyGithub queries) can reuse the virtualenv even though the current guard relies on the GH CLI.
- Guarded the label validation step so manual dry-run or statistics-only dispatches skip enforcement, avoiding false positives during rehearsals.

**Next up**
1. Mirror the discovery-state gate inside `ops-issue-processing` so processing only starts once issues reach `state::assigned`.
2. Capture before/after telemetry JSON from the assignment workflow and reference the artifacts in the migration checklist for DevOps readiness.
3. Draft rollout guidance summarizing GH Action guardrails alongside the canonical state transitions.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`


## 2025-10-03 — Integration Baseline Captured & Sample Issue Artifact Published

**What happened**
- Ran the integration dry run (`tests/integration/test_workflow_pipeline.py`) to establish a fresh baseline after recent telemetry work; confirmed the unified state machine, Markdown sections, and Copilot handoff remain aligned with the target contract.
- Generated a production-derived sample issue body via `IssueHandoffBuilder` and published it to `artifacts/sample_issue_body.md`, giving rollout owners a concrete reference for `## AI Assessment`, `## Specialist Guidance`, and `## Copilot Assignment` formatting.
- Resolved workflow validation warnings by adding `trigger_labels` to `intelligence-analysis-workflow.yaml` and `osint-research-workflow.yaml`, ensuring the matcher loads cleanly for upcoming CI gating.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Treat the integration test as a prerequisite for GitHub Actions updates—CI wiring will mirror today’s command now that workflow definitions pass validation.
- Preserved the builder-driven artifact to avoid doc/code drift; future dry runs should regenerate the file rather than hand-editing Markdown.
- Capture the trigger label uplift as part of WF-05/WF-08 documentation so downstream teams know the canonical label set.

**Next up**
1. Thread the integration pytest into the planned GH Actions smoke suite alongside the CLI dry run.
2. Capture companion JSON telemetry artifacts during the next dry run and link them from the checklist.
3. Draft rollout guidance summarizing the canonical trigger label sets for intelligence and OSINT workflows.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration/test_workflow_pipeline.py -v`


## 2025-10-02 — Leadership Readiness Snapshot & Checklist Update

**What happened**
- Produced a leadership-facing readiness assessment summarizing implementation progress, remaining gaps, and rollout risks.
- Marked the WF-08 CLI dry-run validation task complete in `migration_checklist.md`, documenting the latest passing run.
- Outlined the sequence for upcoming actions (integration test, artifact capture, GitHub Actions alignment, telemetry ingestion) to unblock production rollout.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Treat the project as ~80% complete: engineering changes are in place, but rollout packaging (artifacts, automation updates, enablement) remains the critical path.
- Defer integration test execution until GitHub Actions scripts are updated to mirror the unified pipeline, ensuring CI captures the final contract.
- Prioritize artifact capture and DevOps wiring before scheduling the joint dry-run with operations.

**Next up**
1. Run `pytest tests/integration/test_workflow_pipeline.py -v` and archive logs alongside sample issue bodies.
2. Update `ops-*` GitHub Actions workflows to use `process-issues` exclusively and add smoke tests.
3. Wire telemetry JSONL ingestion into dashboards/alerts ahead of rollout rehearsal.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`


## 2025-10-02 — Label/State Contract Documented for Workflow Deliverables

**What happened**
- Expanded `docs/workflow/deliverables/README.md` with the unified label/state model, required Markdown sections, and the end-to-end state machine so reviewers have a single source of truth during rollout.
- Marked the corresponding migration checklist item complete with contextual notes, keeping WF-08 documentation tasks current.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Documented the state machine inline with the deliverables README instead of a separate ADR so workflow authors have immediate context while editing YAML schemas.
- Added a reminder in best practices to declare `specialist::` labels in workflow metadata, reinforcing the new state transition guardrails.

**Next up**
1. Backfill screenshot or sample issue excerpts showing the updated sections once the orchestrator fixtures produce stable Markdown.
2. Mirror the label/state summary in `docs/workflow/deliverables/CHANGELOG.md` (to be created) when we start formalizing documentation releases.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`


## 2025-10-02 — CLI Telemetry Summaries Emitted Without Downstream Publishers

**What happened**
- Added CLI-level telemetry summary events for the `monitor` and `process-issues` commands so JSONL artifacts are produced even when downstream services are stubbed or skip publishing.
- Introduced a `_emit_cli_summary` helper that wraps every `process-issues` exit path, emitting consistent telemetry metadata for preflight failures, single-issue runs, batch executions, and find-only workflows.
- Hardened the monitor command to capture exceptions, publish telemetry with failure context, and preserve the existing operator-facing error handling.
- Extended the end-to-end CLI dry-run test to assert the new telemetry files contain the expected `site_monitor.cli_summary` and `process_issues.cli_summary` events.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Reused the existing telemetry publisher plumbing and truncated message previews to avoid bloating JSONL output while still recording command context.
- Moved CLI validation after telemetry initialization so preflight failures still emit artifacts for observability dashboards.
- Ensured summary events piggyback on the same static field metadata (`workflow_stage`, `monitor_mode`, `processing_mode`) introduced in the previous telemetry update.

**Next up**
1. Backfill dashboard queries and alerting rules to leverage the new stage metadata once DevOps confirms ingestion.
2. Consider surfacing the `assignment_mode` note in CLI JSON outputs for scripts that parse machine-readable results.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`

---

## 2025-10-02 — CLI Assignment Mode Surfaced & Stage Telemetry Standardized

**What happened**
- Updated the `assign-workflows` CLI flow to announce the detected assignment mode (`AI-enhanced` vs. `Label-based (fallback)`) so operators can confirm routing without enabling verbose logs.
- Threaded `workflow_stage` metadata through the site-monitor and process-issues telemetry publishers, adding command-specific mode tags (`monitor_mode`, `processing_mode`) to keep dashboards aligned with pipeline stages.
- Extended the end-to-end CLI dry-run test to assert on the new status line and verify the telemetry helpers receive the expected static field payloads, preventing regressions.
- Documented the new fields in `telemetry_samples.md` so observability owners know how to pivot JSONL artifacts by stage.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Normalized mode strings (`full`/`aggregate-only`, `batch`/`from-monitor`/`single-issue`/`find-issues-only`) to match the CLI vocabulary used in runbooks.
- Reused `attach_static_fields` instrumentation instead of introducing bespoke event payloads, keeping the telemetry surface consistent across commands.

**Next up**
1. Backfill dashboard queries and alerting rules to leverage the new stage metadata once DevOps confirms ingestion.
2. Consider surfacing the `assignment_mode` note in CLI JSON outputs for scripts that parse machine-readable results.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`

---

## 2025-10-02 — Telemetry Sample Artifacts Documented

**What happened**
- Captured representative JSONL events for AI (`assignment_mode: "ai"`) and fallback (`assignment_mode: "fallback"`) workflow assignment runs and published them in `telemetry_samples.md` for rollout consumers.
- Documented CLI steps and environment overrides so operators can regenerate telemetry artifacts during dry runs or GitHub Actions smoke tests.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Anchored the samples to the structures asserted in `tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py` to keep docs aligned with automated coverage.
- Deferred attaching raw files to the migration checklist until we scope where artifacts should live in the repo (likely `examples/telemetry/`).

**Next up**
1. Evaluate whether CLI stdout should surface the detected assignment mode to aid manual operators during staged rollouts.
2. Mirror the mode metadata in site-monitor and process-issues telemetry so orchestrator dashboards can pivot by workflow stage.

**Validation**
- _Documentation-only change; no code paths executed._

---

## 2025-10-02 — Workflow Assignment Telemetry Exposes Mode Metadata

**What happened**
- Added a reusable `attach_static_fields` helper and CLI wiring so telemetry streams capture the active assignment agent alongside mode metadata.
- Updated AI and fallback workflow assignment agents to stamp `assignment_mode` on batch start/summary and per-issue events, ensuring JSONL outputs differentiate AI vs. heuristic runs.
- Expanded unit and e2e coverage to assert on the new telemetry field, preventing regressions and documenting the expected JSON contract.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Standardized on the lowercase string values (`"ai"`/`"fallback"`) to keep dashboards and downstream parsers simple while preserving the existing `agent_type` field for backward compatibility.
- Wrapped CLI publishers rather than mutating event payloads in place to avoid duplicating logic across commands and to keep future metadata additions cheap.

**Next up**
1. Evaluate whether CLI stdout should surface the detected assignment mode to aid manual operators during staged rollouts.
2. Mirror the mode metadata in site-monitor and process-issues telemetry so orchestrator dashboards can pivot by workflow stage.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/agents/test_ai_workflow_assignment_agent.py tests/unit/agents/test_workflow_assignment_agent.py tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`

## 2025-10-02 — CLI Pipeline Exercises Label-Based Fallback

**What happened**
- Updated `tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py` expectations so the dry-run harness now asserts on the label-based fallback branch (`--disable-ai`) and ensures the CLI advertises "Label-based (fallback)" along with processed issue counts and clarification messaging.
- Captured the fallback invocation in the pipeline event log, verifying the orchestration sequence includes the new `assign_fallback` hop before processing batches and monitoring follow-up commands.
- Confirmed telemetry artifacts still land in `assign-workflows.jsonl` while the find-issues-only JSON output remains unchanged, protecting downstream automation that consumes both outputs.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Kept the event-sequence assertion explicit to prevent regressions where fallback work might silently stop running while the rest of the pipeline stays green.
- Left the stub fallback agent lightweight—no template rendering—to keep the e2e test fast; deeper Markdown assertions will come once we wire in richer fixtures.

**Next up**
1. Capture sample fallback issue artifacts for the migration checklist so rollout docs clearly show expected labels and Markdown sections when AI is unavailable.
2. Expand fallback coverage to include multi-issue statistics and error-path assertions once orchestrator stubs can simulate richer outcomes.
3. Emit a dedicated telemetry attribute (e.g., `mode: "fallback"`) so observability dashboards can differentiate AI vs. heuristic runs during phased rollout.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`

## 2025-10-02 — Fallback Workflow Assignment Aligned with Target State

**What happened**
- Reworked `WorkflowAssignmentAgent.assign_workflow_to_issue` to use the shared state manager so fallback runs now promote issues to `state::assigned`, add `workflow::` labels, and clear `monitor::triage` in one shot.
- Added a structured fallback `## AI Assessment` renderer that documents label-based rationale for specialists and preserved CLI/state machine expectations even when AI classification is disabled.
- Hardened body handling and label diffing, updated unit coverage to assert on label additions/removals and Markdown sections, and refreshed batch-processing tests to keep regression guardrails tight.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Mirror the AI agent’s slug/specialist derivation logic locally for now; will extract to a shared helper once both paths stabilize.
- Treat non-string issue body payloads defensively to keep mocked/legacy data from tripping Markdown utilities during dry runs.

**Next up**
1. Extend the CLI e2e harness to exercise `--disable-ai` so we assert on the new fallback assessment content end-to-end.
2. Capture sample fallback issues for the migration checklist to document expected labels/sections when AI is unavailable.
3. Evaluate surfacing fallback mode in telemetry events for better observability during staged rollouts.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/agents/test_workflow_assignment_agent.py -v`

## 2025-10-01 — Preview Mode Pipeline & Coverage

**What happened**
- Implemented `IssueProcessingStatus.PREVIEW` and `GitHubIntegratedIssueProcessor.generate_preview_result()` so dry-run paths return rendered specialist/Copilot sections without mutating GitHub state.
- Threaded preview handling through `BatchProcessor` metrics (`preview_count`) and CLI formatting to surface 🔍 preview summaries alongside standard results.
- Added `tests/unit/core/test_issue_processor_preview.py` to exercise the preview renderer end-to-end using a typed `IssueHandoffBuilder` mock, ensuring Markdown sections and metadata stay in sync with handoff contracts.
- Ran the full pytest suite to confirm the new preview flow and metrics updates stay green across unit, integration, and e2e coverage.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Swapped loose stubs for `Mock(spec=IssueHandoffBuilder)` to satisfy strict typing and catch signature drift early.
- Deferred lint execution because `flake8` is missing from the local virtualenv; capturing it here so we remember to add the dependency before the next review.
- Preview outputs reuse existing branch/file naming helpers, keeping downstream artifact links deterministic even when no GitHub writes occur.

**Next up**
1. Install `flake8` (or update `requirements-dev.txt`) so lint checks run alongside pytest in local automation.
2. Capture preview artifacts in CLI dry-run docs to help operators understand the new output format before rollout.
3. Wire telemetry publishers to flag preview runs separately from completed executions for observability dashboards.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v`

## 2025-10-01 — CLI Markdown Section Surfacing

**What happened**
- Enriched `ProcessingResult` with specialist guidance and Copilot assignment sections, wiring `_finalize_copilot_handoff` to hydrate the new fields so downstream consumers see the full handoff contract.
- Updated `process-issues` CLI plumbing and site-monitor serialization to carry the sections through batch payloads, including monitor-driven processing paths.
- Extended the end-to-end CLI dry-run harness to capture `safe_execute_cli_command` results and assert on the rendered Markdown blocks, ensuring tests fail if sections drift from the target-state template.
- Refreshed unit coverage (`test_issue_processor_handoff`, `test_site_monitor`) to verify the new fields persist via direct GitHub integration paths and telemetry-friendly serialization.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Patched the CLI harness rather than altering production logging so we can introspect `CliResult.data` without changing operator-facing output.
- Left `IssueResultFormatter` untouched; consumers inspect structured data instead of bloating stdout with full Markdown.
- Site monitor error payloads now include the new keys (set to `None`) to keep JSON contracts stable even when processing fails early.

**Next up**
1. Swap the CLI dry-run stubs to call the real `IssueHandoffBuilder` once workflow fixtures are cheap to load, removing the static strings added today.
2. Add the pending `--find-issues-only` empty-list assertion outlined on 2025-10-01 to round out CLI regression coverage.
3. Thread the section payloads into telemetry/export artifacts so GitHub Actions can archive sample Markdown alongside JSON metrics.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/core/test_issue_processor_handoff.py tests/unit/core/test_site_monitor.py tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`

## 2025-10-01 — CLI Find-Issues-Only Coverage

**What happened**
- Extended the CLI end-to-end harness to cover `process-issues --find-issues-only`, stubbing the batch processor and GitHub client so we exercise the JSON discovery output path without touching the network.
- Verified the command returns deterministic issue metadata for CI/CD pipelines by asserting on the printed JSON payload inside the e2e test.
- Captured telemetry side effects and pipeline event ordering to ensure the new branch plays nicely with existing monitor, assignment, and processing sequences.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Patched the batch processor at the module level inside the test to keep production code untouched while still validating the CLI wiring.
- Reused shared dummy issue data so future assertions (e.g., Markdown section inspection) can piggyback on the same fixtures without rework.
- Left room to expand the stub processor to emit Markdown sections once the CLI surfaces them, keeping today’s test focused on the discovery JSON contract.

**Next up**
1. Extend the CLI dry-run harness to parse the specialist/Copilot Markdown sections once the orchestrator stub is upgraded to call the real builders.
2. Add a negative-path scenario where `find_site_monitor_issues` returns an empty list to verify the CLI surfaces `[]` without errors.
3. Wire the new JSON output example into the migration checklist so DevOps can reference an approved find-only payload during rollout.

**Validation**

## 2025-10-01 — Copilot Handoff Regression Harness

**What happened**
- Added `tests/unit/core/test_issue_processor_handoff.py` to exercise `_finalize_copilot_handoff` with a fully stubbed GitHub issue, ensuring specialist guidance and Copilot sections are upserted and label transitions advance to `state::copilot` while clearing `monitor::triage`.
- Verified the unit test asserts that the Copilot assignee is applied and that workflow labels persist, catching regressions in issue body formatting or label drift before CLI e2e coverage runs.
- Ensured the handoff builder mock still receives the full context (workflow info, files, metadata) so any signature changes surface immediately in the new regression harness.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Opted for a lightweight unit test using low-overhead stubs to avoid GitHub client initialization while still exercising the real slug/label transition logic from `workflow_state_manager`.
- Captured section content via `extract_section` so the test verifies rendered Markdown verbatim, aligning with the template contract in `specialist_alignment.md`.
- Reused the default Copilot assignee constant to guarantee the test stays in sync with future configuration tweaks.

**Next up**
1. Expand CLI e2e assertions so dry-run outputs surface the updated `## Specialist Guidance`/`## Copilot Assignment` blocks, complementing the unit-level guard.
2. Backfill a negative-path test where the workflow matcher fails to locate metadata, validating the graceful skip path.
3. Capture a sample issue body post-handoff for the migration checklist artifacts to unblock WF-08 documentation needs.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/core/test_issue_processor_handoff.py -v`

## 2025-10-01 — Workflow Assignment Statistics Telemetry

**What happened**
- Instrumented the `assign-workflows --statistics` CLI path to emit a structured `workflow_assignment.statistics_view` telemetry event so manual audits show up alongside batch runs.
- Captured success/failure metadata and the returned statistics payload in the telemetry emission, keeping observability dashboards aware of ad-hoc usage.
- Extended the CLI E2E dry-run harness to cover the statistics mode, stubbed agent stats, and asserted the JSONL telemetry stream includes the new event contract.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Reused the existing CLI telemetry session wiring to avoid new configuration knobs; the event automatically lands in `artifacts/telemetry/assign-workflows.jsonl`.
- Dropped the event on failure as well so missing stats still leave an audit trail with the surfaced error.
- Test harness keeps assertions focused on telemetry emission rather than stdout formatting to reduce brittleness as messaging iterates.

**Next up**
1. Feed the statistics telemetry into the migration checklist (`migration_checklist.md`) once GH Actions wiring begins so DevOps can confirm coverage.
2. Evaluate whether we should emit a complementary CLI startup/shutdown telemetry event for statistics-only invocations to capture duration data.
3. Audit other read-only CLI paths (`status`, `cleanup --dry-run`) for similar observability gaps.

**Validation**
- `pytest tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`

---

## 2025-10-01 — AI Workflow Assignment Telemetry Instrumented

**What happened**
- Threaded CLI telemetry through `assign-workflows`, wiring the command to `prepare_cli_telemetry_publishers` so each invocation captures dry-run/limit metadata alongside a JSONL artifact.
- Extended `AIWorkflowAssignmentAgent` to accept telemetry publishers, emitting `batch_start`, per-issue `issue_result`, and `batch_summary` events with AI insights, outcome status, and timing data.
- Added helper methods (`add_telemetry_publisher`, `_emit_issue_result_telemetry`) plus structured payloads that surface top suggested workflows, confidence scores, and error context.
- Bolstered coverage with a focused unit test for telemetry emission and updated the CLI e2e harness to accommodate the new constructor signature.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Issue-level telemetry truncates AI summaries to 240 characters to keep JSONL lines compact while still highlighting rationale for downstream dashboards.
- Summary events classify runs as `success`, `partial`, `empty`, or `error`, giving GitHub Actions quick status signals without parsing raw CLI output.
- Retained the existing 0.5s inter-issue delay but can bypass it in tests via `time.sleep` patching, keeping real runs polite to external APIs and tests fast.

**Next up**
1. Emit a lightweight telemetry event for `assign-workflows --statistics` so observability captures manual audit runs.
2. Feed the new telemetry artifacts into the rollout checklist (`migration_checklist.md`) once DevOps wiring for GH Actions begins.
3. Consider persisting telemetry session IDs on issue comments to make cross-referencing JSONL logs easier during incident reviews.

**Validation**
- `pytest tests/unit/agents/test_ai_workflow_assignment_agent.py -v`
- `pytest tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`

---

## 2025-10-01 — CLI Telemetry JSONL Export Hooked Into Monitor & Processing

**What happened**
- Added `create_jsonl_publisher` and CLI helper wiring so every CLI invocation provisions a JSONL telemetry sink with `cli_command`/`cli_session_id` metadata.
- Updated `main.py` to thread telemetry publishers through `monitor` and `process-issues` flows, covering normal batch execution, `--from-monitor`, and `find-issues-only` branches.
- Documented the telemetry contract plus override env vars in the workflow refactor README for DevOps consumers.
- Introduced focused unit/e2e coverage verifying JSONL writing and CLI wiring respects environment overrides.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Default artifact path is `artifacts/telemetry/{command}.jsonl`; `SPECULUM_CLI_TELEMETRY_PATH` and `SPECULUM_CLI_TELEMETRY_DIR` allow CI to redirect output cleanly.
- CLI wrappers enrich every downstream event (e.g., `batch_processor.summary`, `site_monitor.summary`) without mutating existing payload structure, keeping analytics backward-compatible.
- Reused the same publisher list when monitor processing is invoked from `process-issues --from-monitor` so a single session captures both orchestration hops.

**Next up**
1. Emit explicit telemetry events from the workflow assignment agent once AI rationale persistence is stabilized, ensuring `assign-workflows` sessions capture activity today missing.
2. Add a lightweight CLI startup/shutdown event so commands without downstream publishers (e.g., pure stats requests) still leave an audit trace.
3. Plumb the new JSONL artifacts into the GitHub Actions workflow to persist telemetry blobs as run artifacts for dashboard ingestion.

**Validation**
- `pytest tests/unit/utils/test_telemetry.py tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`

---

## 2025-10-01 — Telemetry Pipeline Now Surfaces Copilot SLA Signals

**What happened**
- Created `src/utils/telemetry.py` with normalized event publishing helpers and defensive error handling.
- Wired `BatchProcessor`, `ProcessingOrchestrator`, and `SiteMonitorService` to accept telemetry publishers and emit summary events containing Copilot aggregation data (including `metrics.copilot_assignments.next_due_at`).
- Added monitoring-cycle and existing-issue telemetry emissions so site monitor runs report SLA risk to any configured dashboards.
- Extended unit coverage (`test_batch_processor.py`, `test_site_monitor.py`) to assert telemetry events contain the Copilot due-date signals.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Telemetry events follow a shared schema with `event_type`, ISO timestamp, and structured payload to keep downstream exporters simple.
- Publisher failures are logged and ignored to preserve pipeline resiliency.
- Orchestrator now normalizes publishers once, letting CLI/automation plug in JSONL writers or metrics bridges without patching individual services.

**Next up**
1. Provide a default JSONL telemetry publisher for CLI commands so dry-run automation captures events automatically.
2. Thread telemetry registration through `main.py` to persist events during GitHub Actions runs.
3. Document the telemetry contract and sample payloads in the workflow refactor README for DevOps consumers.

**Validation**
- `pytest tests/unit/core/test_batch_processor.py tests/unit/core/test_site_monitor.py -v`

## 2025-10-01 — Copilot Metrics Surfaced in Monitor Hand-offs

**What happened**
- Extended `SiteMonitorService.process_existing_issues()` to build `BatchMetrics` with Copilot assignment counts, assignees, due dates, and expose `next_copilot_due_at` in the returned payload.
- Updated the `process-issues --from-monitor` CLI branch to hydrate those metrics, preserve Copilot handoff details per issue, and fall back gracefully when older monitor payloads lack the new fields.
- Augmented test coverage with a targeted unit test for the monitor service metrics and refreshed the CLI e2e stub to assert on Copilot metadata flowing end-to-end.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Metrics parsing normalizes ISO timestamps (including `Z` suffixes) so downstream automations receive consistent datetime structures.
- Retained backward compatibility by recomputing metrics when monitor payloads omit the new contract, ensuring existing dry-run fixtures and older artifacts still work.
- Copilot assignment tracking keys off the presence of assignee/due-at/handoff data to avoid inflating counts on partial or failed runs.

**Next up**
1. Feed the new `metrics.copilot_assignments.next_due_at` into monitor/batch telemetry publishers so dashboards highlight upcoming SLA risk automatically.
2. Wire GitHub Actions smoke steps to assert on the metrics payload, catching regressions in Copilot metadata before production runs.
3. Capture a sample monitor-driven issue body showing the refreshed specialist/Copilot sections for WF-08 documentation artifacts.

**Validation**
- `pytest tests/unit/core/test_site_monitor.py tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`

## 2025-10-01 — Site Monitor Auto-Handoff Integration

**What happened**
- Swapped `SiteMonitorService` over to `GitHubIntegratedIssueProcessor`, feeding it the active `config.yaml` path so monitor-driven automation now reuses the full unified pipeline instead of the headless core processor.
- Added guarded helpers that normalize GitHub issue objects, route them through `process_github_issue`, and serialize Copilot metadata, ensuring monitor-triggered runs emit the same handoff fields (`copilot_assignee`, `copilot_due_at`, summaries) captured elsewhere.
- Updated CLI factory wiring so `create_monitor_service_from_config` threads the config path into the service, preventing stale config resolution and keeping tests aligned with the new constructor signature.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Normalized timestamp data coming from PyGitHub by coercing naive UTC datetimes to timezone-aware instances; this keeps `IssueData` serialization stable without mutating the upstream objects.
- Left a defensive fallback that rebuilds an `IssueData` payload when a non-GitHub-integrated processor is injected during tests, keeping existing fixtures lightweight while still exercising the new serialization contract.
- Extended the unit integration test to assert on Copilot metadata so future regressions in the monitor-to-processor bridge will fail loudly.

**Next up**
1. Feed the enriched monitor processing output into batch metrics so scheduled runs surface `copilot_assignments.next_due_at` alongside existing summary data.
2. Capture a dry-run artifact from the monitor CLI path showcasing the new Specialist/Copilot sections for WF-08 documentation.
3. Evaluate whether the monitor service should expose a JSON payload writer similar to `BatchProcessor.save_batch_results` for workflow telemetry hooks.

**Validation**
- `pytest tests/unit/core/test_site_monitor.py -v`

---

## 2025-10-01 — Copilot Metadata Surfaced for Automation Hooks

**What happened**
- Added `ProcessingResult.to_dict()` serialization so CLI data payloads and saved artifacts expose workflow, Copilot, and Git metadata without bespoke parsing.
- Extended `BatchMetrics` with Copilot aggregation (assignment counts, assignees, due dates, earliest deadline) plus a `to_dict()` helper for JSON-friendly output.
- Updated CLI batch/single processing flows and `BatchProcessor.save_batch_results()` to emit the new metadata, ensuring automation can capture due dates directly from command results or saved reports.
- Augmented unit coverage around batch metrics serialization, result dict export, and file persistence to lock in the contract.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Treat any completed result that includes Copilot metadata or handoff summary as an assignment so metrics remain truthful even if due dates are missing.
- Invalid or non-ISO due date strings degrade gracefully by shoving them to the end of the ordering rather than exploding parsing logic.
- Retained human-friendly CLI output while enriching the underlying data payloads, preserving operator readability and new automation hooks simultaneously.

**Next up**
1. Plumb the enriched metrics into telemetry/metrics publishing so dashboards can visualize Copilot load and SLA risk.
2. Update GitHub Actions smoke steps to persist the JSON payload and assert on `copilot_assignments.next_due_at` for early warning.
3. Revisit discovery/assignment flows to ensure they always populate due dates before the processor kicks in, avoiding empty aggregates.

**Validation**
- `pytest tests -v`

---

## 2025-10-01 — Copilot Handoff Metadata in CLI Results

**What happened**
- Extended `ProcessingResult` to capture Copilot assignee, due date, and the unified handoff summary emitted by `IssueHandoffBuilder`.
- Refactored the GitHub handoff routine to return the full payload, wiring its metadata back into `_handle_processing_result`.
- Surfaced the new details via `IssueResultFormatter`, so CLI runs now display the Copilot target and due timestamp alongside workflow output.
- Updated the CLI e2e harness to emulate the richer metadata and assert on the new `🤖 Copilot` line for regression coverage.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Returning the payload keeps `_handle_processing_result` resilient to future template changes while exposing everything downstream consumers need.
- CLI output only renders the first line of the handoff summary to stay concise; the full text still lands in the issue body/comment.
- Stubbed due dates in the e2e harness using deterministic timestamps to avoid brittle assertions while proving the formatting contract.

**Next up**
1. Thread the Copilot metadata into JSON outputs/metrics so automation hooks can capture the due date programmatically.
2. Add an integration test that inspects the issue body after processing to confirm the Specialist/Copilot sections match the target-state templates.
3. Evaluate whether monitor-driven paths should precompute due windows so Copilot deadlines align with SLA expectations.

**Validation**
- `pytest tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py -v`

---

## 2025-10-01 — AI Assessment Rationale & Migration Prep

**What happened**
- Enhanced the AI workflow assignment output to add confidence-weighted rationales in the `## AI Assessment` section, ensuring recommended workflows cite topics, indicators, urgency, and content type before assignment.
- Updated `IssueHandoffBuilder` parsing so specialist guidance surfaces the enriched rationale details, keeping downstream prompts aligned with the new contract.
- Extended unit, integration, and agent tests to cover the updated Markdown structure and added a dedicated check for the new rationale formatting.
- Drafted `migration_checklist.md` to map the refactor deliverables to WF-08/WF-09 GitHub Actions rollout tasks.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Rationale text is derived from existing AI signals to avoid additional API calls while still contextualising workflow selection for reviewers.
- Confidence formatting now uses explicit `Confidence: NN%` wording so parsing remains stable even if percentages are missing or provided as decimals.
- Checklist emphasises dry-run coverage and GH Actions readiness, giving DevOps a concrete handover artifact.

**Next up**
1. Feed the new rationale text into CLI dry-run stubs so `tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py` can assert on Markdown section updates end-to-end.
2. Populate the migration checklist with owners/dates as WF-08 validation completes.
3. Coordinate with DevOps on updating `ops-workflow-assignment.yml` once AI assessment persistence lands in staging.

**Validation**
- `pytest tests/unit/workflow/test_issue_handoff_builder.py tests/integration/test_workflow_pipeline.py tests/unit/agents/test_ai_workflow_assignment_agent.py -v`

---

## 2025-10-01 — Specialist Guidance Contract Alignment

**What happened**
- Reworked `IssueHandoffBuilder` to emit the specialist guidance structure defined in `specialist_alignment.md`, including explicit persona headers, AI insight bullets, numbered action lists, and deliverable checklists with filename hints.
- Added collaboration notes that surface working branches and escalation paths so Copilot receives the same operational cues as specialists.
- Refreshed the unit and integration tests to assert on the new contract and replaced private helper usage in the integration suite with local fixtures so linting stays green.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Introduced defensive fallbacks when specialist configs are unavailable; logging now captures config load failures without breaking issue processing.
- Normalized deliverable references to prefer workflow definitions while still surfacing generated artifacts, keeping guidance actionable even before file scaffolds exist.
- Kept Copilot assignment formatting stable but now clarify the issue context in the summary to reinforce the connection between guidance and execution.

**Next up**
1. Extend the CLI dry-run coverage to assert on the refreshed Markdown sections once template builders are wired through the stub orchestrator.
2. Audit `AIWorkflowAssignmentAgent` output to ensure the `## AI Assessment` block populates the new insight fields (urgency, indicators) consistently.
3. Start drafting a migration checklist that maps these template changes to the GitHub Actions rollout tasks in WF-08/WF-09.

**Validation**
- `pytest tests/unit/workflow/test_issue_handoff_builder.py tests/integration/test_workflow_pipeline.py -v`

---

## 2025-10-01 — CLI Edge Case Coverage

**What happened**
- Expanded `tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py` to drive the `process-issues` command through both the `--from-monitor` branch and the single-issue clarification path.
- Stubbed the monitor integration to simulate mixed success/error returns so the CLI now renders batch summaries sourced from site-monitor handoffs.
- Added verification that clarification responses surface the expected messaging, guarding the force-clarification and single-issue flows that were previously untested.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Reused the existing dry-run scaffolding so validators, config substitution, and logging contract continue to execute without hitting real services.
- Favored end-to-end coverage over unit stubbing so future CLI refactors will break loudly if option wiring or output formatting changes.
- Left the `--find-issues-only` branch for a follow-up once we have a lightweight stub of the batch finder logic; this keeps the current change focused and green.

**Next up**
1. Extend the e2e harness to capture Markdown section updates once the template builders are invoked during processing.
2. Add an e2e scenario around `--find-issues-only` to validate CI discovery output formatting.
3. Socialize the richer CLI coverage with DevOps so the dry-run smoke checks include these branches.

---

## 2025-10-01 — CLI Dry-Run Pipeline Validation

**What happened**
- Added `tests/e2e/test_workflow_cli_pipeline.py` to exercise the monitor → assign-workflows → process-issues flow through `main.py` using stubbed services and dry-run wiring.
- Stubbed the site monitor, AI assignment agent, and processing orchestrator inside the test to capture pipeline events while still relying on real CLI validation (config parsing, environment substitution, progress formatting).
- Verified the CLI prints success summaries for each stage and that the orchestrated calls occur in the expected order with the right parameters, matching the target-state label/state transitions scaffold.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Kept `ConfigValidator` checks active so the test proves the CLI honors real config + workflow directory expectations instead of bypassing validation.
- Reused `BatchMetrics`/`ProcessingResult` structures in the stub to ensure downstream formatting logic receives the same shapes as production, preventing regressions in output rendering.
- Captured stdout to assert on key success markers, giving us confidence that automation (e.g., GitHub Actions) will observe the expected CLI messaging when chained.

**Next up**
1. Layer additional scenarios (e.g., `--from-monitor`, clarification paths) to exercise alternate CLI code branches once supporting mocks are ready.
2. Expand the new e2e test to persist and inspect Markdown sections once we wire real template builders into the CLI stubs.
3. Coordinate with DevOps to incorporate the CLI dry-run into pre-deploy smoke checks, ensuring pipeline health before production pushes.

---

## 2025-10-01 — Integration Pipeline Dry Run Validation

**What happened**
- Added `tests/integration/test_workflow_pipeline.py` to exercise the monitor → assign → process → Copilot flow using the shared state manager and handoff builder.
- Simulated discovery intake, AI assignment, issue processing, and Copilot handoff transitions to confirm labels, Markdown sections, and summary metadata stay in sync.
- Verified the new integration behaves with real workflow definitions and specialist configs loaded from `docs/workflow/deliverables`.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Leaned on `AIWorkflowAssignmentAgent` helper methods for workflow/specialist slugs so the test mirrors production label generation.
- Exercised `IssueHandoffBuilder` end-to-end to validate section rendering without relying on GitHub mocks, improving confidence in downstream automation.
- The test doubles as a regression guard for future label taxonomy or template changes—failures will immediately flag contract drift.

**Next up**
1. Wire a CLI-level dry-run scenario (likely under `tests/e2e/`) that orchestrates the same pipeline via `main.py` to complement the logic-level integration covered here.
2. Expand fixtures to cover multiple workflows and specialist variations to guard against schema regressions.
3. Capture Copilot completion automation expectations in tests once the webhook/state advancement work lands.

## 2025-09-30 — Legacy Copilot CLI Retired

**What happened**
- Removed the `process-copilot-issues` CLI surface from `main.py`, routing all Copilot handoff orchestration through the unified `process-issues` path.
- Deleted `BatchProcessor.process_copilot_assigned_issues` and its dedicated tests, ensuring there is only one batch execution surface.
- Refreshed documentation across the workflow refactor and historical issue-processing guides to call out the new single entrypoint and mark the legacy command as deprecated.
- Ran the full unit suite (`pytest tests/ -v`) to confirm the unified path remains green after the removals.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Preserved `GitHubIntegratedIssueProcessor.get_copilot_assigned_issues` for observability/reporting use cases while removing pipeline entrypoints that depended on it.
- Added lint guards in the simplified Copilot assignment tests so we can continue exercising private helpers without triggering style failures.
- Left TODO markers in documentation where downstream automation updates (e.g., GitHub Actions) still need to be aligned in the rollout phase.

**Next up**
1. Update GitHub Actions/task definitions so schedulers invoke only `process-issues` with the appropriate arguments.
2. Build the monitor → assign → process integration scenario to validate single-entrypoint behavior end-to-end under dry-run.
3. Enable Copilot completion webhooks to advance issues from `state::copilot` to `state::done` automatically once outputs land.

## 2025-09-30 — Unified Copilot Handoff Automation

**What happened**
- Introduced `IssueHandoffBuilder` to assemble standardized specialist and Copilot sections from workflow metadata, discovery details, and AI assessments.
- Extended `GitHubIntegratedIssueProcessor` to generate Copilot-ready issue updates: upserted guidance/assignment sections, advanced labels to `state::copilot`, reassigned issues to `@github-copilot[bot]`, and posted consolidated completion summaries.
- Captured workflow execution metadata (branch, commit, output directory) in `ProcessingResult` so downstream automation can reference generated artifacts.
- Added unit coverage for the new handoff builder and enhanced Markdown tooling to read existing sections when updating issue bodies.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Builder outputs exclude section headings, allowing `upsert_section` to preserve existing document structure while refreshing content idempotently.
- Workflow labels are normalized via the slugified workflow name to ensure consistent `workflow::` tags even when assignment skipped earlier stages.
- Copilot handoff gracefully degrades when workflow definitions are missing or specialist configs fail to load, keeping legacy completion comments as a fallback.

**Next up**
1. Fold the legacy `process-cilot-issues` CLI into the unified path and retire redundant automation hooks.
2. Backfill integration tests that cover monitor → assign → process pipeline with mocked GitHub responses to validate the new Copilot state transitions.
3. Wire Copilot completion webhooks/automation to transition issues from `state::copilot` to `state::done` and archive deliverable branches automatically.

## 2025-09-30 — AI Assignment Label & Section Persistence

**What happened**
- Introduced `src/utils/markdown_sections.py` with helpers to upsert Markdown sections reliably and added unit coverage under `tests/unit/utils/test_markdown_sections.py`.
- Enhanced `AIWorkflowAssignmentAgent` to use `plan_state_transition` for high-confidence assignments, automatically clearing `monitor::triage`, applying `state::assigned`, and appending `workflow::`/`specialist::` labels derived from workflow metadata.
- Persisted structured AI assessment details inside the issue body’s `## AI Assessment` section across auto-assign, review, and clarification paths.
- Updated agent comments to reference persisted assessments and to report applied labels for better auditability.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Slugified workflow names to generate deterministic `workflow::` labels while preserving legacy trigger labels for backward compatibility.
- When specialist metadata is unavailable in the workflow definition, the agent skips adding `specialist::` labels to avoid guesswork; future schema updates should surface this consistently.
- Markdown section utility caches compiled regex patterns to minimize repeated compilation during batch runs.

**Next up**
1. Build shared specialist/Copilot section generators so `process-issues` can emit standardized guidance blocks.
2. Refactor `process-issues` to consume workflow state helpers, remove the legacy Copilot command, and manage state transitions end-to-end.
3. Extend AI assignment tests with mocks around GitHub interactions to validate transition planning logic without network calls.

## 2025-09-30 — Discovery Intake Standardization

**What happened**
- Reworked `GitHubIssueCreator.create_individual_result_issue` to run `ensure_discovery_labels`, guaranteeing `monitor::triage` and `state::discovery` are attached alongside existing monitor labels.
- Replaced the discovery issue body with the refactor-aligned intake template, including `## Discovery`, `## AI Assessment`, `## Specialist Guidance`, and `## Copilot Assignment` sections plus actionable next steps.
- Extended default monitoring label scaffolding to provision the new workflow state labels for repositories during setup.
- Added unit coverage in `tests/unit/clients/test_github_issue_creator.py` to assert label application, template structure, and label bootstrap behaviour.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Chose to append the new labels without mutating caller-provided casing to avoid surprises when custom labels exist; new labels follow lowercase convention for consistency.
- Embedded an explicit command hint in the discovery template to guide operators toward the AI assignment flow until automation is fully wired.
- The placeholder sections intentionally remain textual for now; specialized markdown builders will replace them once shared template utilities land.

**Next up**
1. Teach the AI workflow assignment agent to call `plan_state_transition(..., clear_temporary=True)` and persist the `## AI Assessment` block.
2. Introduce shared markdown/template helpers so specialist guidance and Copilot sections can be generated consistently across services.
3. Begin refactoring `process-issues` to emit the standardized specialist guidance block and manage state transitions without the legacy Copilot command.

## 2025-09-30 — Workflow State Utilities Foundation

**What happened**
- Added `src/workflow/workflow_state_manager.py` centralizing label/state definitions (`monitor::triage`, `state::*`, workflow/specialist prefixes).
- Implemented transition helpers (`ensure_discovery_labels`, `plan_state_transition`, `get_state_from_labels`, `is_at_least_state`).
- Backed the helpers with unit coverage in `tests/unit/workflow/test_workflow_state_manager.py`; test run: `pytest tests/unit/workflow/test_workflow_state_manager.py -v`.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Transition helpers return additive/removal sets so we can integrate with both GitHub API interactions and pure label lists.
- Normalizing labels to lowercase to avoid duplicate casing from existing issues; downstream integrations should preserve this convention.
- Deferred templating helpers for issue body sections to a subsequent step to keep this change focused on labels/state.

**Next up**
1. Wire `SiteMonitorService` issue creation to consume `ensure_discovery_labels` and emit the target-state discovery template.
2. Update AI workflow assignment to call `plan_state_transition(..., clear_temporary=True)` when promoting issues to `state::assigned` and persist the `## AI Assessment` block.
3. Start drafting shared markdown template utilities for specialist and Copilot sections.

## 2025-09-30 — Kickoff & Orientation

**What happened**
- Reviewed existing documentation in `docs/development/workflow_refactor/` to understand scope, success criteria, and phased plan.
- Analyzed key code entry points (`site_monitor.py`, `ai_workflow_assignment_agent.py`, `issue_processor.py`, `main.py`) to map proposed target-state changes to current implementation.
- Drafted high-level execution plan covering:
  - discovery label/state normalization and helper utilities,
  - AI assignment updates for assessment persistence + label transitions,
  - unified issue processor updates and command deprecation,
  - supporting tests/documentation refresh.

**Decisions / Notes**
- Introduce shared state-transition helpers (likely under `src/utils/` or `src/workflow/`) to manage `monitor::triage` and `state::*` labels consistently across services.
- Standardize issue body sections (`## Discovery`, `## AI Assessment`, `## Specialist Guidance`, `## Copilot Assignment`) as part of refactor; templates to be added incrementally during implementation.
- Deprecate `process-copilot-issues` CLI once unified processor covers Copilot handoff; flag existing automation for update in later phase.

**Next up**
1. Prototype shared workflow-state utilities and add accompanying unit tests.
2. Update site monitoring issue creation to emit discovery template + state/label changes.
3. Start wiring AI assignment persistence of `## AI Assessment` and label transitions.
