# AI-Powered Content Extraction & Documentation Strategy

## Overview

Transform the Speculum Principum issue processor from template-based generation to AI-powered content extraction and structuring, focusing on intelligence analysis workflows for organizing information about target sites and organizations.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Architecture
- **Issue Processing**: Template-based content generation with basic AI workflow assignment
- **Workflow System**: YAML-defined deliverables with static templates
- **Content Generation**: Fallback strategies with placeholder content
- **AI Usage**: Limited to workflow assignment via GitHub Models API

### Limitations
- No actual content extraction from issues
- Static template-based output
- Limited specialist workflow support
- No structured data organization for intelligence analysis

## Vision: Intelligence-Driven Documentation System

### Target Capabilities
1. **Automatic Content Extraction**: AI analyzes Copilot-assigned issues to extract structured information
2. **Specialist Workflows**: Intelligence analyst, OSINT researcher, threat analyst personas
3. **Entity Organization**: Structure information about people, places, things, events
4. **Dynamic Documentation**: AI-generated analysis rather than static templates
5. **Multi-Agent Processing**: Support for different specialist agents with unique capabilities

## Strategic Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement (Infrastructure)

#### Step 1.1: Copilot Assignment Detection
**Objective**: Modify issue processor to identify and prioritize Copilot-assigned issues

**Implementation Areas**:
- `src/core/issue_processor.py`: Add Copilot assignment filtering
- `src/core/batch_processor.py`: Update batch discovery for assignee filtering
- `main.py`: Add CLI options for Copilot-assigned issue processing

**Changes Required**:
```python
# New method in GitHubIntegratedIssueProcessor
def get_copilot_assigned_issues(self, limit: Optional[int] = None) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Get issues assigned to GitHub Copilot for AI processing."""
    
def is_copilot_assigned(self, issue_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """Check if issue is assigned to GitHub Copilot."""
    return issue_data.get('assignee') in ['github-copilot[bot]', 'copilot']
```

#### Step 1.2: AI Content Extraction Engine
**Objective**: Create core AI content extraction capabilities

**New Components**:

**Core Architecture**:
```python
class ContentExtractionAgent:
    """AI-powered content extraction from GitHub issues."""
    
    def extract_structured_data(self, issue_data: IssueData) -> StructuredContent:
        """Extract people, places, things, events from issue content."""
        
    def generate_specialist_analysis(self, content: StructuredContent, 
                                   specialist_type: str) -> AnalysisResult:
        """Generate analysis from specialist perspective."""
```

#### Step 1.3: Specialist Workflow Framework
**Objective**: Create framework for specialist-oriented workflows

**New Components**:
- `src/workflow/specialist_workflows.py`: Specialist workflow definitions

class StructuredContent:
    """Structured content extracted from issues."""
    entities: Dict[str, List[Entity]]  # people, places, organizations, etc.
    events: List[Event]               # timeline of activities
    relationships: List[Relationship] # connections between entities
    indicators: List[Indicator]       # IOCs, TTPs, etc.
    metadata: ContentMetadata         # source, confidence, extraction_method
```

**AI Prompting Strategy**:
```python
def build_extraction_prompt(self, issue_content: str) -> str:
    return f"""Extract structured information from this intelligence report:

    def generate_strategic_insights(self, content: StructuredContent) -> StrategicAnalysis:
        """Generate high-level strategic analysis."""
```

**OSINT Researcher Agent**:
```python
class OSINTResearcherAgent(SpecialistAgent):
    """AI agent with OSINT research capabilities."""
    
    def verify_information(self, content: StructuredContent) -> VerificationReport:
        """Cross-reference and verify extracted information."""
