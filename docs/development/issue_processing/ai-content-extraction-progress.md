## Task 1.1: Copilot Issue Detection - ✅ COMPLETED

**Implementation Date**: December 27, 2024  
**Assignee**: Backend Agent  
**Priority**: High  

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Issue Processor Enhancements
- **File**: `src/core/issue_processor.py`
- **New Methods**:
  - `get_copilot_assigned_issues(limit: Optional[int] = None) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`
    - Queries GitHub for issues assigned to Copilot usernames
    - Supports limiting results
    - Filters issues through `_should_process_copilot_issue()`
  
  - `is_copilot_assigned(issue_data: Union[Dict[str, Any], Any]) -> bool`
    - Checks if an issue is assigned to GitHub Copilot
    - Supports both dictionary and GitHub issue object formats
    - Recognizes: `github-copilot[bot]`, `copilot`, `github-actions[bot]`
  
  - `_should_process_copilot_issue(issue) -> bool`
    - Determines if a Copilot-assigned issue should be processed
    - Checks for intelligence indicators in labels: `intelligence`, `research`, `analysis`, `target`, `osint`, `site-monitor`
    - Also checks title and body content for these keywords
  
  - `_convert_issue_to_dict(issue) -> Dict[str, Any]`
    - Converts GitHub issue objects to standardized dictionary format
    - Extracts labels, assignees, timestamps, and metadata

#### 2. Batch Processor Enhancements
- **File**: `src/core/batch_processor.py`
- **New Method** (historical):
  - `process_copilot_assigned_issues(specialist_filter: Optional[str] = None, dry_run: bool = False)`
    - Processed all Copilot-assigned issues in batches
    - Supported filtering by specialist type: `intelligence-analyst`, `osint-researcher`, `target-profiler`, `threat-hunter`, `business-analyst`
    - Returned batch metrics and processing results

> **Update — 2025-09-30:** The dedicated Copilot batch helper has been retired. All batch execution now flows through `BatchProcessor.process_issues`, which handles Copilot handoff via shared state transitions.

#### 3. CLI Command Implementation
- **File**: `main.py`
- **New Command** (historical): `process-copilot-issues`
- **Arguments**:
  - `--config`: Configuration file path (default: config.yaml)
  - `--specialist-filter`: Filter by specialist type
  - `--batch-size`: Maximum issues per batch (default: 5)
  - `--dry-run`: Preview mode without making changes
  - `--verbose`: Detailed progress reporting
  - `--continue-on-error`: Keep processing despite individual failures

> **Update — 2025-09-30:** The standalone command has been removed. Use `python main.py process-issues` with label filters/state transitions for Copilot processing.

#### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- **File**: `tests/unit/core/test_copilot_assignment_simple.py`
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Copilot assignment detection with dictionaries and objects
  - Issue processing criteria validation
  - Issue-to-dictionary conversion
  - Specialist filtering logic
- **All tests passing**: ✅ 5/5 tests pass

### Usage Examples

```bash
# List what Copilot issues would be processed (dry run)
python main.py process-issues --label-filter state::assigned --dry-run --verbose

# Process all Copilot issues
python main.py process-issues --label-filter state::assigned --continue-on-error

# Process only intelligence analyst issues
python main.py process-issues --label-filter state::assigned specialist::intelligence-analyst

# Process with custom batch size and continue on errors
python main.py process-issues --label-filter state::assigned --batch-size 3 --continue-on-error --verbose
```

### Acceptance Criteria Status
