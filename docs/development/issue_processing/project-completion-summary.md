#### Phase 2: Core AI Implementation (100% Complete)  
- **OSINT Researcher Agent**: Digital reconnaissance and information verification
- **AI-Enhanced Document Generation**: Professional report generation with quality validation
- **Quality Assurance Framework**: IC-standard validation and compliance checking
- **Multi-Stage Processing**: Sophisticated content analysis and synthesis

#### Phase 3: Specialist Workflows (67% Complete - Core Complete)
- **Target Profiler Agent**: Organizational analysis and stakeholder mapping
- **Specialist Workflow Configuration**: Centralized workflow management system
- **Advanced Assignment Logic**: Multi-factor specialist selection and coordination
- **Professional CLI Tools**: Comprehensive command-line interface for operations

### ❌ **Canceled Phase (Phase 4)**

#### Phase 4: Integration & Enhancement (Canceled - September 29, 2025)
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Canceled due to scope reduction
- **Enhanced CLI Integration**: Dependent on orchestration, canceled
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Canceled, existing test coverage sufficient (74%)
