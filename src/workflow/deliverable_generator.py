Deliverable Generator

This module handles the generation of structured deliverable documents based on
workflow specifications and issue data. It provides template-based content
generation with support for various deliverable types and formats.

Key Components:
- DeliverableGenerator: Main class for generating deliverable content
- Template system integration for consistent document structure
- Content generation logic for different deliverable types
- Validation and formatting utilities

The generator is designed to be extensible and can be integrated with AI content
generation services in the future.
